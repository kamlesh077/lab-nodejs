// 3. Age in Days.
// Write a JavaScript function called ageInDays that accepts an object containing a person's first name, last
// name, and age in years as input. The function should concatenate the first and last name into a single string
// and store it in a variable called fullName. It should then calculate the person's age in days and store it in a
// variable called ageInDays.
// The ageInDays function should then return a callback function that logs a message to the console. The
// message should include the person's full name and age in days, and should be in the format: "The person's full
// name is [full name] and their age in days is [age in days]."
// Note that the ageInDays function should not log the message to the console directly, but should instead return
// a callback function that can be used to log the message at a later time.


function ageInDays(personObject, callback) {
    const fullname =`${personObject.Firstname} ${personObject.Lastname} `
    const ageindays = personObject.Age * 365
    callback(fullname, ageindays)
}

function logresult(fullname,ageindays) {
    console.log(`The person's full name is ${fullname} and their age in days is ${ageindays}.`);
}


const  person = {
    Firstname : "Kamlesh",
    Lastname : "Choudhary",
    Age : 22
